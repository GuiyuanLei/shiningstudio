From August 2016 to March 2017, I have crocheted many Pokemons, including whole series of eeveelutions, Chikorita baby kit for my mum’s friend, Pikachu as a gift for a little boy’s birthday.

On Sunday 19th March 2017, I did a sponsored 5 mile walk for the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity. My team (Team Eevee) raised over £700. We are called Team Eevee because we all carried an eeveelution crocheted by me.

Here is the list of pokemons I have made: 

* Eeveelution
* Pikachu
* Chikorita
* Oddish 
* Togepi
* Abra
* Super Pichu
* Charmander
* Vaporeon
* Dragonair
* Pichu
* Poliwhirl
* Wigglytuff
