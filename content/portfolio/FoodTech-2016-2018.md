I like to apply art to food. For example I [decorated my birthday cake with fondant roller skates](https://shiningstudio.netlify.com/portfolio/skatecake28may2015/) and carved some apple animals. I also enjoyed food tech at secondary school. I made food such as Cous cous salad, Rock buns and Spaghetti.
