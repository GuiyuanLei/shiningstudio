My mum bought me a sewing machine as a Christmas present in 2013. Since then I have made several dresses for my sister and myself.

I just post a few of dresses here, including costumes I made for primary school leavers party (2016), Christmas play (2015) and Victorian day (2014).

To see all dresses that I made, you can visit my wordpress blog:
