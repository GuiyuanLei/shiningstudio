To enter a poster design UK competition "Echoes of the Silk Road", I tried several ideas.

<!--more-->

The following posters were four of my designs (from latest to oldest by date). I like the one with a girl and an airplane most, it took me more than 3 hours to design/draw this poster. It was improved from the early design (see the picture at the bottom) by adding blue sky and an airplane to connect China and UK. I drew this one on iPad using ibisPaint app. The color is much brighter than the one I drew on paper with watercolor (the early version). You can choose any color you want in e-Design. I also spent more time on the detail of hair (shade etc).
